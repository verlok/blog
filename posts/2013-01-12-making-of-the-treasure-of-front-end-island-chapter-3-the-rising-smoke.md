Ahoy, front-end pirates! Welcome to the Chapter 3 of the [Making of The Secret of Front-end Island]({% post_url 2012-12-09-making-of-the-treasure-of-front-end-island %}) saga: **the Rising Smoke**.

![Front-end Island Rising Smoke](/assets/post-images/Front-end-Island-Rising-Smoke-709x237.png)

In the layout the smoke was composed by 5 gray circles at different opacity. Oh joy! I could avoid using images using markup and border-radius, and animate every smoke ball using CSS 3 only. Challenging, then funny. :)

## Structure of the page

As explained in the [previous post]({% post_url 2012-12-09-making-of-the-treasure-of-front-end-island-chapter-1-the-splashing-title %} "Making of The Treasure of Front-end Island – Chapter 1 – The splashing title"), I divided the site into many `section`s:

- **event**
- speakers
- description
- city
- venue
- cart
- and so on…

The DOM path of the smoke parent element is the following:

`#event > #horizon > #smoke`

## The smoke markup

By the layout, 5 balls of smoke are visible at the same time. To make a beautiful animation, I decided to double them. Here's the markup for the 10 balls of smoke.

```html
<div id="smoke">
  <span class="s0"></span>
  <span class="s1"></span>
  <span class="s2"></span>
  <span class="s3"></span>
  <span class="s4"></span>
  <span class="s5"></span>
  <span class="s6"></span>
  <span class="s7"></span>
  <span class="s8"></span>
  <span class="s9"></span>
</div>
```

## The CSS 3 only animation

The smoke animation can perfectly be developed in CSS 3 only.

I used Modernizr to test whether the browser supports CSS 3 animations or not. Modernizr adds the `cssanimations` class if the browser supports animations, or the `no-cssanimations` if it doesn't.

The `disableAnimations` class is toggled when the user presses the "disable animations" button on the page (maybe to save battery life).

So here's the code:

```css
/* Smoke container */
#smoke {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 3;
  width: 1px;
  height: 160px;
  left: 50%;
  bottom: 116px;
}

/* No animations or animations disabled? Display a static smoke image */
.disableAnimations #smoke,
.no-cssanimations #smoke {
  width: 86px;
  margin-left: -25px;
  bottom: 146px;
  background: url("../img/smokeNoAni.png") no-repeat center bottom;
}

/* smoke balls */
.cssanimations #smoke span {
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  bottom: -35px;
  left: 50%;
  margin-left: -20px;
  height: 0px;
  width: 0px;
  border: 35px solid #4b4b4b;
  border-radius: 35px;
  left: -14px;
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(0.2);
}
```

Until now, the smoke container is positioned and all the smoke balls are positioned to its bottom and scaled to 20%.

And here's where the magic happens. I created two different animations, `smokeL` for the smoke balls which moved up and left, and `smokeR` for the smoke balls which moved up and right.

```css
@keyframes smokeL {
  0% {
    transform: scale(0.2) translate(0, 0);
  }
  10% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(0.2) translate(0, -5px);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(1) translate(-20px, -130px);
  }
}

@keyframes smokeR {
  0% {
    transform: scale(0.2) translate(0, 0);
  }
  10% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(0.2) translate(0, -5px);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(1) translate(20px, -130px);
  }
}
```

Then I applied this two animations alternately to each smoke ball, with a total duration of 10 seconds, and a delay of 1 second more each.

Here's how:

```css
#smoke .s0 {
  animation: smokeL 10s 0s infinite;
}
#smoke .s1 {
  animation: smokeR 10s 1s infinite;
}
#smoke .s2 {
  animation: smokeL 10s 2s infinite;
}
#smoke .s3 {
  animation: smokeR 10s 3s infinite;
}
#smoke .s4 {
  animation: smokeL 10s 4s infinite;
}
#smoke .s5 {
  animation: smokeR 10s 5s infinite;
}
#smoke .s6 {
  animation: smokeL 10s 6s infinite;
}
#smoke .s7 {
  animation: smokeR 10s 7s infinite;
}
#smoke .s8 {
  animation: smokeL 10s 8s infinite;
}
#smoke .s9 {
  animation: smokeR 10s 9s infinite;
}
```

And that's it! The smoke animation works perfectly on modern browsers!

Here's the result:
