Googling **respond.js vs css3-mediaqueries.js** I've found [Techniques For Gracefully Degrading Media Queries](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/10/techniques-for-gracefully-degrading-media-queries/), a Smashing Magazine post about [Lewis Nyman](http://lewisnyman.co.uk) which talks about how to apply the **graceful degradation** of media queries on browsers that don't support them (IE 8, IE 7, IE 6).

The options are:

- Use a **separate style sheet** to load conditionally on old Internet Explorer versions, or separate style rules to apply based on the body class
- Use a **javascript fallback** (using **respond.js** or **css3-mediaqueries.js**)

In case of javascript fallback, the best may be **respond.js**, in the following case:

- Desktop support is a primary high concern;
- You are querying only the width and height of the browser;
- You don’t want to query the width by ems;
- You have no problem with non-JavaScript users seeing an unoptimized page

In my opinion, this is a very frequent case!

CSS3-mediaqueries.js is indicated only if you have **particular conditions** to query (other than width and height), but it weights 15 freaking kilobytes!

So you should use respond.js and switch to css3-mediaqueries.js only if the first doesn't fit your needs.

That's it!
