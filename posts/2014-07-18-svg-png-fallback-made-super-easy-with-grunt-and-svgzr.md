It was recently released the **SVGZR** Grunt Plugin, which makes super-easy to implement SVG icons in your website, with automatic PNG fallback for older <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> versions.

SVGZR will help you to:

- take all the SVG images from an input folder
- compress the SVG removing useless data from the SVG format
- embed all the SVG images in a CSS file (using the base64 encoding), each one with a specific class name referring to the file name
- create a PNG sprite image as a fallback for legacy browsers

You can find the Grunt Plugin and more information at this [SVGZR GitHub page](https://github.com/aditollo/grunt-svgzr), and you can install it as a [NPM module](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-svgzr).
