On Tuesday, 22nd September 2015 the first [YOOXlabs tech event](http://techevents.yooxlabs.com/) took place in Bologna, Italy and I spoke about agile CSS development using SASS and Compass.

Here's the post about [advanced sprites generation using Compass (SASS)]({% post_url 2015-03-06-advanced-sprite-generation-using-compass-sass %}) that I mentioned during the speech.

Here are the slides I presented:
