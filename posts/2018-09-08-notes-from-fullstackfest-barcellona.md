I just returned from Barcellona where I attended the Full Stack Fest Conference, which was I think the best one I've ever attended in the latest years.

I wrotes my notes on the talks on [this repo on GitHub](https://github.com/verlok/fullStackFest2018).

I hope you find them useful! Ah, and I accept pull requests for integrations.
