**PicturePolyfill 4** is out! Implementing responsive images in your site has never been so simple and fast.

## Most important features

- the `source` parsing algorithm behavior: it now exits at the first matching media query instead of at the last one, as the native implementation does
- one `img` tag is now mandatory, as defined in the [picture tag specification](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/embedded-content.html#the-picture-element)
- the `srcset` attribute inside the `img` tag is now better managed, in browsers that support it
- the script is now lighter than before, because the functions to create the `img` tag were removed
- the script is now even faster because it now parses only the matching `srcset` attribute, and not all of them as before
- the internal cache system is still in place and working fine but  you can avoid using it (just in case you need to) passing a parameter
