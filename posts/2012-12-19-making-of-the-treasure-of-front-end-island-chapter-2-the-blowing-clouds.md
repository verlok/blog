Ahoy, front-end pirates! Welcome to the Chapter 2 of the [Making of The Secret of Front-end Island]({% post_url 2012-12-09-making-of-the-treasure-of-front-end-island %}) saga: **the Blowing Clouds**.

![](/assets/post-images/blowing_clouds1.jpg "The clouds sprite")

As I described [before]({% post_url 2012-12-09-making-of-the-treasure-of-front-end-island-chapter-1-the-splashing-title %} "Making of The Treasure of Front-end Island – Chapter 1 – The splashing title"), in the Photoshop layout I got from the designer ([Diego Sessa](http://www.linkedin.com/in/diegosessa "Diego")) I had the finished 1280 pixel wide layout, and I had the discretion of choosing animations, responsive behavior, and so on.

For the blowing clouds I decided to make a "blow left and right" effect using CSS 3 only. I also wanted the clouds to move at different speeds.

Here are the steps of what I did:

## The clouds sprite

I created a new empty, transparent image and copied the 4 clouds in it. After trimming the empty pixels, I saved it as transparent png (8 bit also in this case, instead of 24 bit, to save lots of kilobytes).

## Structure of the page

As explained in the [previous post]({% post_url 2012-12-09-making-of-the-treasure-of-front-end-island-chapter-1-the-splashing-title %} "Making of The Treasure of Front-end Island – Chapter 1 – The splashing title"), I divided the site into many `section`s:

- **event**
- speakers
- description
- city
- venue
- cart
- and so on…

The **event** section contains the *From the Front* logo, the *The Treasure of Frontend Island* splash image, the event day, time and location, and the graphic of the island with the trees, the smoke, the sea, etc.

Then, I divided again the **event** section in 4 `div`:

- ftfPresents
- **treasure**
- eventInfo
- horizon

Inside the **treasure** `div` I placed:

- **the clouds markup**
- the splash image
- the event summary
- the event type

## The clouds markup

Here's the markup for the 4 clouds. I like to use semantic IDs and very short class names, when needed, to keep the html light.

```html
<div id="clouds">
  <span class="c1"></span>
  <span class="c2"></span>
  <span class="c3"></span>
  <span class="c4"></span>
</div>
```

## The clouds stylesheet portion

And here's the CSS that makes the sprite to split into pieces. As you see I use the span tag to apply the background image and the absolute position, and the classes c1, c2, c3 and c4 to offset it, size it and give it a z-index value.

Each cloud has a different z-index because some clouds are behind [the splashing title]({% post_url 2012-12-09-making-of-the-treasure-of-front-end-island-chapter-1-the-splashing-title %} "Making of The Treasure of Front-end Island – Chapter 1 – The splashing title"), some others are in front of it.

```css
/* Clouds */
#clouds span {
  background: url("../img/clouds.png") no-repeat top left;
  position: absolute;
}

#clouds .c1 {
  width: 206px;
  height: 89px;
  left: -75px;
  top: -38px;
  z-index: 3;
}

#clouds .c2 {
  background-position: -260px 0px;
  width: 270px;
  height: 102px;
  left: 590px;
  top: 206px;
  z-index: 8;
}

#clouds .c3 {
  background-position: 0px -99px;
  width: 255px;
  height: 81px;
  left: -95px;
  top: 278px;
  z-index: 3;
}

#clouds .c4 {
  background-position: -272px -114px;
  width: 129px;
  height: 56px;
  left: 504px;
  top: 463px;
  z-index: 12;
}
```

## The blowing animation

Let the wind blow! Here's how the animation is done. As you see, it's quite simple.

There are two types of clouds: A and B. The A type translates horizontally by only 50px, the B type translates by 100px. This makes the user to perceive some deepness of the sky.

So I wrote two keyframes definitions: cloudA and cloudB.

```css
/* Clouds animation keyframes */
@keyframes cloudA {
  0% {
    transform: translate(0px);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translate(50px);
  }
}

@keyframes cloudB {
  0% {
    transform: translate(0px);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translate(100px);
  }
}
```

To make the clouds move all together, I applied the keyframes to the elements giving it the same duration: 15 seconds. The animation goes back and forth infinite times using the easing function "ease-in-out", which makes the animation both start slow and end slow.

```css
/* Clouds animation appliance */
#clouds .c1,
#clouds .c4 {
  animation: cloudA 15s 0s infinite alternate ease-in-out;
}

#clouds .c2,
#clouds .c3 {
  animation: cloudB 15s 0s infinite alternate ease-in-out;
}
```
