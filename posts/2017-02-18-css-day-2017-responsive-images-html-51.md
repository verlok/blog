On March 17th 2017 I spoke about **responsive images, an HTML 5.1 standard** at the [CSS Day 2017 Conference](http://2017.cssday.it) in Faenza, Italy. The speech was on web performance, since using responsive images is a way to serve lighter images to smaller screens (and viceversa) and images optimization. I also took a sneak peek on how to generate the right size for your images in the cloud using a software as a service.

Here are the slides of my talk, from my <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/verlok">SlideShare</a>:

<div class="slideshareWrapper">
    <iframe class="lazy" id="ssFrame" width="100%" data-src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/cxLve2h1ruQvPK"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

They are also available as video, where you can **watch the videos embedded in the presentation** and appreciate the meaning of the "elastic images" vs "elastic spaces" slides.
