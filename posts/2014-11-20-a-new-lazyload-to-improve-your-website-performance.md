In the latest days I've been working on websites performance optimization and I realized that there is no way to take advantage of the **progressive JPEG** image format on websites if you're using [jQuery_lazyload](https://github.com/tuupola/jquery_lazyload "Mika Tuupola"). So after sending a pull request to its author, I decided to write my own lazy load, which turned out to be better, because:

- it's 6x faster
- it allows you to [lazy load responsive images]({% post_url 2015-04-20-lazy-load-responsive-images-srcset %})
- it doesn't depend on jQuery
- it best supports the progressive JPEG format
